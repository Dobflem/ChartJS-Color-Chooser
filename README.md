# ChartJS-Color-Chooser
Allows you to quickly change chart color to find a color that fit your needs.

## TODO

#### Update the directory structure
* Create a folder for src files.
* Maybe create a build script to minimise files.

#### Add styling to page
* Make it look a bit less thrown together.
* Resize the Chart so it doesn't go fullscreen.

#### Add more charts
* Add pie charts, bar charts, all ChartJS charts.

#### Make it more customizable
* Allow users to change the fill color opacity from 0.2.
* Allow users to specify how many lines and points they'd like.
* Allow users to change the color of each individual line / arc / etc..
* Allow users to import their own data.
* Allow users to export the code to create their customized chart.
